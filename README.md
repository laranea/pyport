# Python Finance Portfolio Research

Repo intended to assist in portfolio strategy research. Built on python. Currently in the very early stages of development. 

## Why I'm doing this.
I'm mainly doing this for myself so that I might learn and grow. When I worked on the original project back in graduate school I found this to be the type of work that put all my skills to use and then some. It felt like all my classes had led to this one project. By expanding this project I can keep those skills sharp and hopefully learn along the way. All feedback and/or help is appreciated!

## Ok, so...

## The Big Picture: build a robust framework to assist in researching complex portfolio strategies. My approach is, if I find something that helps, I'll add it. 

## Summary Goal Stages:

1) Investigate findata.py as potential dependency. (unsure at the moment)
2) Improve the code usability.  <-- Done!
> 2.1) Ability to handle an all equity portfolio efficienct allocation
>> 2.15) Something like a markowitz portfolio optimziation as a python object.
>> 2.16) Ability to show portfolio statistcs and paint the efficient frontier and random allocation space of the portfolio.

3) Overhaul the backend and work on code efficiency. (partially covered)
4) Overhaul tracking returns work.
